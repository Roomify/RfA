# Roomify for Accommodations
This is the Roomify distribution for vacation rentals, hotels and multi-property agencies. It is based on [Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org), a highly popular and functional open-source content management system. It includes special offers, location-based search, email guest reminders, owner/guest communication tools and [many other features](https://github.com/Roomify/RfA/wiki/Features). The [Roomify team](https://roomify.us) is available for customization work, just [get in touch](https://roomify.us/get-started).

## Easy Install on platform.sh
To evaluate RfA for free on [platform.sh](https://platform.sh/), just [go here](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/roomify/setup) and sign up/in. The initial installation will take around 10 minutes - once it's finished, just go to your demo site and login with admin/admin - be sure to update your password and email address.

## Quickstart
* Just go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Roomify/RfA/releases/latest) and download the roomify-accommodations-default.{version}.zip file. You will find a completely built codebase and database dump to use on any hosting provider that supports PHP.
* Alternatively, you may use our [docker container](https://github.com/Roomify/rfa-docker) to quickly create a local demo environment.
* See our [full installation instructions here](http://docs.roomify.us/accommodations_selfhost/index.html).
* Once you have installed your site, sign in and use the [quick setup tool](http://docs.roomify.us/roomify_accommodations/configuration/quicksetup.html#roomify-accommodations-quicksetup).
