# Roomify for Accommodations
This is the Roomify distribution for vacation rentals, hotels and multi-property agencies. It is based on [Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org), a highly popular and functional open-source content management system. It includes special offers, location-based search, email guest reminders, owner/guest communication tools and [many other features](https://github.com/Roomify/RfA/wiki/Features). In addition, integrated channel management services are available [by subscription](https://cloud.roomify.us/channel-management-roomify). The [Roomify team](https://roomify.us) is available for customization work, just [get in touch](https://roomify.us/get-started).
